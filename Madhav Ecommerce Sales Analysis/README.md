# Madhav Ecommerce Sales Analysis


### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of Madhav Ecommerece Technologies. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, channel popularity, highest selling category, gender based sales and make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance. By using Power BI, I created a dashboard to visualize different findings as well.


### Data Sources

The primary dataset  used for this analysis are the 'Orders.csv' file and 'Details.csv' file, containing details about sales, category, category , date etc. 


### Tools Used 

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- Microsoft Power BI - Data Analysis and Visualization by Creating dashboards/reports


### Data Cleaning / Preparation 

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks :
  
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

  1. Which state has the highest profit by sub-category?
  2. Which payment mode has the highest quantity for sales?
  3. Which product made the highest sales by sub-category?


### Data Analysis

For my data analysis , I have used several advanced Excel operations such as pivot tables, bar charts etc. and in Power BI, I used several DAX functions and data models to create the dashboards. 


### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

  1. Maharastra has the highest profit by sub-category.
  2. COD(Cash on Delivery) mode has the highest quantity for sales.
  3. Printers made the highest sales by sub-category.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

  - Try to cater the people from Maharastra as that state has the highest profit.
  - See if the orders made are mostly COD, because that has the highest demand.also keep other payment options as it is.
  - Invest more on Printers as they are the highest selling product. 


### Limitations 

I removed some null values from several columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my findings. There might be still some outliers which can affect some corelation between two different catrgories.
