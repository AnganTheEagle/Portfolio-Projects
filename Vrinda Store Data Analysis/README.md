# Vrinda Store Data Analysis


### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of Vrinda Store in the year 2022. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, channel popularity, highest selling category, gender based sales and make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.


### Data Sources

The primary dataset  used for this analysis is the 'Store Data.xlsx' file, containing details about sales, agegroup, category , date etc. 


### Tools Used 

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- Microsoft Word - Data Analysis and FIndings with figures


### Data Cleaning / Preparation 

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks :
  
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

  1. Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
  2. Which is the highest selling category?
  3. Which month got the highest sales and orders?
  4. Who purchased more in 2022? Men or Women?


### Data Analysis

For my data analysis , I have used several advanced Excel operations such as pivot tables, bar charts etc. 


### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

  1. Amazon is the highest contributing channel for this store, contributing 35% to overall sales. 
  2. Set is the highest selling category, with almost 10.5 million sales.
  3. March got the highest crowd for both sales and orders.
  4. Between Men and Women, women got the higher purchase percentage, 64%. 


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

  - Invest in Amazon more and interact with Amazon partners more than other channels since its the highest contributing channel for maximum sales.
  - Since Set is the highest selling category, try making different variations of the product and invest in marketing and promotion.
  - Try attracting more customers in March by marketing and advertisement strtategy since its the highest sales and orders month.
  - Women purchased more in 2022 so cater more to the women customers, since it will affect positive impact on overall sales.


### Limitations 

I removed some null values from several columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my findings. There might be still some outliers which can affect some corelation between two different catrgories.
